# Dive-In!

## Mission Statement
We want to ease the process of icebreaking and help everyone be involved in the icebreaking.,

## Problem Statement
Lots of people get shy or embarrased when they first meet people and play icebreaking with people whom they have never met before. It is also difficult for organizers to lead the icebreaking if players are not involved.
